# My Portfolio
## Description
I am excited to showcase my first portfolio as a boot camp student. 
The purpose of this project was to two-fold.
First, through this project, I was able to practice and apply many of the HTML and CSS concepts that we have learned in class over the past 2 weeks. Concepts like CSS selectors and specificity, flexbox, typography, CSS variables, pseudo classes and elements, responsivity, and accessibility. 

Second, this project is useful because I have essentially created a portfolio that I can use once I graduate from the boot camp. Once I graduate, I will have a job-ready portfolio that I can submit to potential employers. The quality of the portfolio and the projects linked will demonstrate my skills and abilities to potential employers. I plan to keep revising and editing the portfolio throughout the duration of the boot camp.

A challenge that I faced while creating my portfolio was mastering flexbox. I want to master flexbox because it is a type of layout that is versatile and responsive. I know that learning it will pay off in the long run.
